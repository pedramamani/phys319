/* * PHYS319 Lab3 Timing example in C * * Written by Ryan Wicks * 16 January 2012 * * This program is a C version of the assembly program that formed part of lab 2. * This is not the best way to implement timing, or to organize your code.  * It is simply one way. * * This will almost certainly not give exactly the same timing as the assembly * program from lab 2, and the output assembly will also be very different, even * though the task is similar. */#include <msp430.h>void main(void) {    // declare a volatile unsigned integer    // a volatile type ensures the compiler loads the variable every time instead of using a cached value    // removing it reduces the blinking time slightly, since 'count' won't be accessed every time    volatile unsigned int count;    WDTCTL = WDTPW + WDTHOLD;  // stop the watchdog    P1DIR = 0x41;  // set P1.1 and P1.6 as output, these correspond to the green and red on-board leds    P1OUT = 0x01;  // set P1.1 to on, so that the green led turns on    while (1) {  // continuous looping        count = 30000;  // reduce blinking interval by half        while (count != 0)  // decrement until 'count' is zero            count--;        P1OUT = P1OUT ^ 0x41;  // bitwise xor to switch between the leds    }}
